# Steam_Database_Model

This is a model of the gamestore Steam's database, it's not perfect but I had little time before the deadline to make it and had to sacrifice anything that wasn't required of the model like a relation that keeps track of the game transfers that happens between users or a table that keeps track of achievement and so on and so forth.
